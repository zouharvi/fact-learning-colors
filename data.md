### Scale

The exact scale is yet to be determined (number words, sessions and people).
Since we have 7 conditions, we may need e.g. 14 people to get 2 people per condition, and possibly more. 
Depending on whether we accept adaptivity as another factor, that increases the number of conditions.
Naturally, we will be using between-subject design because we can not change the configuration for someone mid-experiment.
