# Learning Foreign Language Vocabulary with Adaptive Color Palette (WIP)

## Introduction / motivation
_Leander_
This user model focuses on enhancing learning a foreign vocabulary. While other user models with similar purpose focus on differing the repetition time between words based on their difficulty for the user, this model uses color instead. 
During the learning process each word is accompanied by a certain color. This color changed based on the difficulty of the word for the user.

## Experiments setup

The experiment will be based on learning words from English to a foreign language, most probably Swahili.
We need 3 contrastive groups:
- G0: no color palette
- G1: color palette chosen by the user
- G2: color palette chosen randomly

Vil√©m also thinks that we should include a fourth control group, _word colors chosen randomly_ to contrast the following phenomenon: 
If a word is for a longer time in e.g. brigh red color, I can associate this with the answer (similar to my *star* example).
In order to rule out that this phenomenon is positively influencing the results (and not the palette), we would need the fourth group of people.

### Adaptivity

Another factor would be the palette working scheme.
Is the palette with a fixed threshold or is it adapted to the current user progress?
- Fixed: 0 incorrect - white, 1-2 incorrect - pink, 3+ incorrect - red
- Adaptive: 20% easiest - white, 20%-50% easiest - pink, 50%-100% easiest (harderst) - red

### Scale

The exact scale is yet to be determined (number words, sessions and people).
Since we have 3 or 4 groups, we may need e.g. 8 people to get 2 people per condition, and possibly more. 
Depending on whether we accept adaptivity as another factor, that increases the amount of conditions.
