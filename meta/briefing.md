# Fact Learning Experiment

In this experiment, you will be tasked with learning Swahili vocabulary.
Specifically, words in Swahili will be shown to you and your goal is to provide English translations.

The structure of the experiment is as follows:
1. Fill in introductory survey (2 min)
2. Start experiment (15 min)
3. Play a game (5 min)
4. Test gained knowledge (5 min)
5. Fill in evaluation survey (1 min)

The time requirements of 2 and 3 are strict, though other tasks may take less or longer.
Overall the experiment is designed to require 30 minutes of your uninterupted attention.
Please read these instructions carefully before commencing with the experiment.

Thank you for your participation!

## 1. Introductory survey

See [here](todo).

## 2. Experiment

To start the experiment, TODO.
The first time you will see a word, its translation will be provided to you, though you will still have to retype it in the answer box.
Every answer has a time limit of 60 second, though the vast majority of responses is expected to happen much earlier.

_C1:_
At the beginning, you will be prompted to select a palette which you think corresponds the most with easy-hard difficulty.
You will see colors on the screen next to each word which represent the estimated difficulty.

_C2:_
You will see colors on the screen next to each word.
For every word, a color is randomly generated and associated.

## 3. Game

After 15 minutes of learning, the screen will change into a countdown timer.
In this period, your task is to play the game TODO.
Please note down your score and engagement level as you will be prompted for this later.

## 4. Testing gained knowledge

After the timer has passed, the experiment screen will prompt you to start the testing.
You will be presented with Swahili words which you've learned and you should provide the English translations.
You will not receive any intermediate feedback.

_C1 and C2:_
You will be evaluated in two phases.
In the first one, you will see all the learned words without any color cues.
In the second phase, you will see the same words, but with the same color scheme as during learning.

## 5. Evaluation survey

See [here](todo).
