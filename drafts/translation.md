- Predicting translation/post-editing time/difficulty
- The goal would be that the person wants to learn to translate from one language to another one.
- And for correct/incorrect we could use reference translations with automatic metrics or self-evaluation.
- And our part would be to predict the future difficulty based on sentence properties in combination with the specific user.
- This is very applicable to MT industry.
